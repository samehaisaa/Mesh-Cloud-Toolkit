# 3D Mesh to Point Cloud: Registration and Visualization

**A modular Python project for converting 3D meshes to point clouds, applying transformations, and visualizing results using Open3D. Includes tools for experimenting with ICP registration and transformation workflows.**

---

## Features

- **Mesh to Point Cloud Conversion**  
  Sample points uniformly or randomly from a 3D mesh file (.obj) to generate point clouds.

- **Transformations**  
  Apply and visualize rigid body transformations (translation, rotation, scaling) on point clouds.

- **Point Cloud Registration**  
  Perform ICP (Iterative Closest Point) alignment, both point-to-point and point-to-plane.

- **Visualization**  
  Render transformed and aligned point clouds with custom colorization for clarity.
